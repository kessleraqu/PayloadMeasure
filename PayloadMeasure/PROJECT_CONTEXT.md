# PayloadMeasure – Master's Thesis Context

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of the research prototype developed as part of my Master's thesis.

**Thesis title**

> Using Computer Vision for Guiding Payload Distribution in Modular Drone Delivery Systems

The application is an iOS AR application intended to assist an operator during the **payload assessment and preparation** stage before a modular delivery drone is assembled and configured.

The project is a research prototype, not a commercial application.

# Research Background

The modular drone platform already supports AR-assisted drone reconfiguration. My contribution is the preceding workflow:

1. Assess the payload.
2. Measure the payload.
3. Estimate relevant properties.
4. Check compatibility with the modular drone platform.
5. Guide the operator during payload preparation.

The app should therefore act as an intelligent measurement and decision-support tool.

# Hardware

## Development machine
- MacBook Air M2

## Test device
- iPhone 13 Pro
- LiDAR Scanner
- ARKit compatible

The simulator should **never** be considered a substitute for testing AR functionality.

---

# Technologies

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- ARKit
- RealityKit
- Vision (later)
- CoreML (optional later)

Avoid Unity unless explicitly requested.

---

# Current Development Status

Current milestone:

✅ Xcode project created

✅ Code signing configured

✅ App runs on physical iPhone

✅ Initial ARView embedded inside SwiftUI

Known issue:
Camera permission (`NSCameraUsageDescription`) still needs to be added before ARKit can access the camera.

# Long-Term Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Foundation

- Launch AR camera
- Start AR session
- Plane detection
- Scene depth
- Verify LiDAR

## Phase 2 — Manual Measurement

- Tap 3D points
- Compute distances
- Measure box dimensions
- Display dimensions

## Phase 3 — Assisted Measurement

- Automatic box detection
- Corner refinement
- Measurement confidence
- Export results

## Phase 4 — Payload Intelligence

Estimate:

- Length
- Width
- Height
- Volume
- Weight (estimated or entered)
- Center of mass (future)

Evaluate:

- Platform compatibility
- Arrangement possibilities
- Payload constraints

# Software Design Principles

- Build incrementally.
- Keep every commit runnable.
- Prefer readability over abstraction.
- Explain every architectural decision.
- Minimize dependencies.
- Test on the physical iPhone after every milestone.

# Coding Guidelines for AI

When modifying the project:

- Read this document first.
- Make the smallest reasonable change.
- Keep the project compiling.
- Explain why each change is necessary.
- Do not perform unnecessary refactoring.
- Prefer native Apple APIs.
- Ask before introducing new frameworks.

When implementing features:

1. First explain the approach.
2. Then implement.
3. Keep code modular.
4. Add comments only where they improve understanding.

# Role of the AI Assistant

Act as a senior iOS + ARKit engineer.

Priorities:

1. Correctness
2. Simplicity
3. Maintainability
4. Research quality
5. Measurement accuracy

The objective is not simply to build an app, but to produce a research-quality prototype suitable for inclusion in a Master's thesis.

Always keep the research objective in mind when proposing implementations.
